- Professional services integration

Here's the plan for full-scale, production-grade development, testing, and integration of all features from your PRD. This will be executed in phases, with each phase including code, infra, and test coverage. I will start with the backend, then frontend, then integration, and ensure everything is scalable, secure, and ready for SaaS/enterprise.

**PHASE 1: Backend Implementation**

1. **Database Models & Alembic Migrations**
   - Users, Tenants, Clusters, Namespaces, Workloads, RBAC, Quotas, NetworkPolicies, Deployments, AuditLogs, Costs.
   - Multi-tenancy: All models are tenant-aware.
   - Encryption at rest: Sensitive fields encrypted.
   - Alembic migrations for all models.

2. **Auth Service**
   - OAuth2/JWT for session management.
   - CLI-based cloud auth: AWS (boto3), Azure (azure-identity), GCP (google-auth).
   - Service account, IAM role, SSO (OIDC/SAML placeholder).
   - Audit logging for all auth events.

3. **Cluster Manager**
   - CRUD for clusters (EKS, AKS, GKE) using cloud SDKs.
   - Namespace, workload, RBAC, quotas, network policy endpoints.
   - All operations async via RabbitMQ.
   - Cost tracking: integrate with cloud billing APIs.

4. **Monitoring Service**
   - Real-time metrics/logs: Prometheus/Grafana/Loki integration.
   - WebSocket endpoints for live updates.
   - Alerting: integrate with Alertmanager.
   - Resource dashboards, cost dashboards.

5. **Deployment Engine**
   - Helm/manifest deployment via python subprocess or SDK.
   - GitOps: ArgoCD/Flux webhook integration.
   - Blue/green, canary, rollback logic.
   - CI/CD pipeline triggers (webhook endpoints).

6. **API Gateway**
   - FastAPI middleware for routing, rate limiting (Redis), multi-tenancy, audit logging.
   - Health and metrics endpoints.

**PHASE 2: Frontend Implementation**

1. **Auth UI**
   - Multi-cloud login, SSO, service account, session management.
   - Tenant switcher for multi-tenancy.

2. **Dashboard**
   - Cluster list, create/delete/scale, namespace/workload management.
   - Real-time metrics, logs, alerts, cost dashboards.
   - RBAC, quotas, network policy management UIs.

3. **Deployment UI**
   - Helm/manifest upload, GitOps repo connect, deployment status.
   - Blue/green, canary, rollback controls.

4. **User/Org Management**
   - User invite, role assignment, audit log viewer.

5. **Enterprise Features**

**Execution:**
- I will now begin with backend models, migrations, and core service logic.
- Then, I'll scaffold the frontend dashboard and connect to backend APIs.
- After that, I'll add tests, CI/CD, and scale features.
- Each step will be committed and ready for review.
