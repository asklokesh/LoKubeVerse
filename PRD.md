# Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Management App Requirements

## Core Functionality
- **Authentication**: CLI-based auth for AWS (EKS), Azure (AKS), GCP (GKE)
- **Management**: Full CRUD operations on K8s resources across all clouds
- **Observation**: Real-time monitoring, logging, metrics aggregation
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline management, GitOps integration

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js dashboard
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for metadata, Redis for caching
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for async operations

## Authentication Requirements
- AWS: `aws configure` + EKS kubeconfig
- Azure: `az login` + AKS credentials  
- GCP: `gcloud auth` + GKE cluster access
- Support for service accounts and IAM roles

## Management Features
- Cluster lifecycle (create/delete/scale)
- Namespace management
- Workload deployment (pods, services, ingress)
- Resource quotas and limits
- RBAC configuration
- Network policies

## Observation Features
- Real-time cluster health monitoring
- Pod/node metrics and logs
- Resource utilization dashboards
- Alert management
- Cost tracking per cluster/namespace

## Deployment Features
- Helm chart management
- Kubernetes manifests deployment
- GitOps workflow (ArgoCD/Flux integration)
- Blue/green and canary deployments
- Rollback capabilities

## Architecture Components
1. **Auth Service**: Multi-cloud credential management
2. **Cluster Manager**: K8s API abstraction layer
3. **Monitoring Service**: Metrics aggregation
4. **Deployment Engine**: CI/CD orchestration
5. **Web Dashboard**: Unified control interface
6. **API Gateway**: Request routing and rate limiting

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Multi-tenancy support
- High availability (99.9% uptime)
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Security: encryption at rest/transit
- Audit logging for compliance
- Performance: <2s response times

## Monetization Potential
- SaaS subscription model
- Enterprise features (SSO, advanced monitoring)
- Multi-cluster management tiers
- Professional services integration

Here's the plan for full-scale, production-grade development, testing, and integration of all features from your PRD. This will be executed in phases, with each phase including code, infra, and test coverage. I will start with the backend, then frontend, then integration, and ensure everything is scalable, secure, and ready for SaaS/enterprise.

---

**PHASE 1: Backend Implementation**

1. **Database Models & Alembic Migrations**
   - Users, Tenants, Clusters, Namespaces, Workloads, RBAC, Quotas, NetworkPolicies, Deployments, AuditLogs, Costs.
   - Multi-tenancy: All models are tenant-aware.
   - Encryption at rest: Sensitive fields encrypted.
   - Alembic migrations for all models.

2. **Auth Service**
   - OAuth2/JWT for session management.
   - CLI-based cloud auth: AWS (boto3), Azure (azure-identity), GCP (google-auth).
   - Service account, IAM role, SSO (OIDC/SAML placeholder).
   - Audit logging for all auth events.

3. **Cluster Manager**
   - CRUD for clusters (EKS, AKS, GKE) using cloud SDKs.
   - Namespace, workload, RBAC, quotas, network policy endpoints.
   - All operations async via RabbitMQ.
   - Cost tracking: integrate with cloud billing APIs.

4. **Monitoring Service**
   - Real-time metrics/logs: Prometheus/Grafana/Loki integration.
   - WebSocket endpoints for live updates.
   - Alerting: integrate with Alertmanager.
   - Resource dashboards, cost dashboards.

5. **Deployment Engine**
   - Helm/manifest deployment via python subprocess or SDK.
   - GitOps: ArgoCD/Flux webhook integration.
   - Blue/green, canary, rollback logic.
   - CI/CD pipeline triggers (webhook endpoints).

6. **API Gateway**
   - FastAPI middleware for routing, rate limiting (Redis), multi-tenancy, audit logging.
   - Health and metrics endpoints.

---

**PHASE 2: Frontend Implementation**

1. **Auth UI**
   - Multi-cloud login, SSO, service account, session management.
   - Tenant switcher for multi-tenancy.

2. **Dashboard**
   - Cluster list, create/delete/scale, namespace/workload management.
   - Real-time metrics, logs, alerts, cost dashboards.
   - RBAC, quotas, network policy management UIs.

3. **Deployment UI**
   - Helm/manifest upload, GitOps repo connect, deployment status.
   - Blue/green, canary, rollback controls.

4. **User/Org Management**
   - User invite, role assignment, audit log viewer.

5. **Enterprise Features**
   - SSO config, advanced monitoring, multi-cluster views.

---

**PHASE 2 Status & Next Steps**

### Current Status
- Core dashboard, clusters, deployments, and users UI implemented
- Auth, clusters, deployments, users API integration done
- Basic login/logout, CRUD, and real-time fetch working
- Basic smoke tests for both backend and frontend

### Known Issues
- SSO, tenant switcher, user invite, role assignment, audit log viewer not implemented
- Namespace, workload, RBAC, quotas, network policy, cost dashboards missing
- Advanced monitoring, multi-cluster, blue/green/canary/rollback deployment controls not present

### Next Steps
- Implement missing UIs and backend endpoints
- Connect new UIs to backend
- Add tests and update docs
- Implement enterprise features
- Add advanced monitoring and multi-cluster views
- Add blue/green/canary/rollback deployment controls
- Add user invite, role assignment, and audit log viewer
- Add SSO config and tenant switcher
- Add namespace/workload/RBAC/quotas/network policy/cost management UIs
- Add Helm, GitOps, blue/green/canary/rollback deployment UI
- Add user invite, role assignment, and audit log viewer
- Add SSO config, advanced monitoring, multi-cluster views
- Connect new UIs to backend endpoints
- Write unit/integration tests for new features
- Update documentation

**PHASE 3: Integration & Testing**

1. **Unit & Integration Tests**
   - Pytest for backend, Jest/React Testing Library for frontend.
   - 90%+ coverage, including async and error paths.

2. **E2E Tests**
   - Playwright/Cypress for full user flows.

3. **Load & Scale Testing**
   - Locust for backend, Lighthouse for frontend.
   - Simulate multi-tenant, multi-cluster, high-concurrency scenarios.

4. **Security & Compliance**
   - Encryption at rest/transit, RBAC, audit logging.
   - Penetration test scripts, static analysis (Bandit, SonarQube).

5. **CI/CD**
   - GitHub Actions for build/test/deploy.
   - Docker Compose for local dev, Helm charts for k8s deploy.

---

**PHASE 4: SaaS/Enterprise Readiness**

1. **Subscription & Billing**
   - Stripe integration, tiered plans, usage metering.

2. **High Availability**
   - K8s manifests for HA, horizontal scaling, readiness/liveness probes.

3. **Documentation**
   - OpenAPI docs, user/admin guides, onboarding flows.

---

**Execution:**
- I will now begin with backend models, migrations, and core service logic.
- Then, I'll scaffold the frontend dashboard and connect to backend APIs.
- After that, I'll add tests, CI/CD, and scale features.
- Each step will be committed and ready for review.
