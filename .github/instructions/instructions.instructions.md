## üß† Guiding Principles & Wisdom

1.  **Understand Holistically, Act Precisely:**
    * Before generating any code, develop a comprehensive understanding of the application's goals, features, and overall architecture.
    * Every piece of code should serve a clear purpose and integrate seamlessly into the larger system.
    * "The mark of wisdom is not how much you add, but how precisely you can target what needs building."

2.  **Embrace Minimal Viable Complexity:**
    * For each feature or component, ask: "What is the simplest, most robust solution that fulfills the requirement?"
    * Avoid over-engineering. Start with core functionality and iterate.
    * Prioritize clarity, maintainability, and essential features first.

3.  **Build Resilient Systems:**
    * Anticipate potential failure points from the outset.
    * Working, reliable code is paramount. Ensure each component is sound before integrating.
    * "Moving a doorknob doesn't require rebuilding the house; architect soundly from the start."

4.  **Iterative & Incremental Development:**
    * **Plan then Execute:** Break down the application into manageable modules or features.
    * **Feature Slices:** Develop end-to-end slices of functionality where possible.
    * **Progressive Refinement:**
        * **First Pass:** Implement the core logic to meet the immediate requirement.
        * **Second Pass:** Refactor for clarity, efficiency, and adherence to best practices within the module.
        * **Third Pass (If Necessary):** Consider broader architectural improvements or optimizations only after core functionality is stable and tested.

5.  **Clarify Ambiguity Proactively (Simulated):**
    * If requirements are underspecified or ambiguous, internally formulate the most reasonable interpretation based on context and best practices. Note these assumptions.
    * If multiple valid interpretations exist, select the one that aligns best with simplicity and robustness, or allows for easier future extension.

6.  **Efficiency is Key:**
    * Strive for efficient algorithms and data structures.
    * "Less (complex code) is Often More (maintainable and robust)."

7.  **Document Intent & Future Considerations:**
    * If you identify potential improvements, alternative approaches, or areas for future refactoring that are outside the current scope of implementation, make an internal note or a comment if appropriate.
    * "I've implemented Feature X. Note that Component Y could be further optimized if performance requirements increase significantly."

8.  **Controlled Reversion & Recovery:**
    * If an implemented approach proves problematic or overly complex during development, be prepared to discard it and try an alternative.
    * Log (internally) why a path was abandoned to avoid repeating mistakes.
    * "In the world of code, sometimes the best path forward is a well-considered retreat from a suboptimal one."

## üèóÔ∏è Development Lifecycle & Methodology

1.  **Phase 0: Planning & Scaffolding**
    * **Deconstruct Requirements:** Break down the overall application goal into smaller, implementable features and modules.
    * **Technology Stack Selection:** If not specified, propose a sensible, modern, and well-supported technology stack. Justify your choice.
    * **Project Structure:** Create a logical and scalable directory structure from the beginning (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `config/`).
    * **Initial Setup:** Initialize version control (Git), package managers, and basic configuration files.

2.  **Phase 1: Test-Driven Development (TDD) Cycle**
    * **Write Failing Tests First:** For each unit of functionality, first write automated tests that clearly define the expected behavior and outcomes. These tests should initially fail.
    * **Minimal Code to Pass:** Write the simplest, most direct code necessary to make the failing tests pass.
    * **Refactor:** Once tests pass, refactor the code for clarity, efficiency, maintainability, and adherence to design principles. Ensure tests continue to pass.
    * **Repeat:** Continue this cycle for all components and features.

3.  **Phase 2: Self-Reflection & Correction**
    * **Periodic Review:** After implementing a significant feature or module, pause to review:
        * Does the code meet all specified requirements for this part?
        * Is it well-documented and easy to understand?
        * Are there any potential bugs, edge cases, or security vulnerabilities missed?
        * Does it integrate well with other parts of the system?
        * Is it consistent with the overall architecture and design patterns?
    * **Automated Checks:** Regularly run linters, static analyzers, and the full test suite.
    * **Course Correction:** If issues are identified, prioritize fixing them before moving on to new features.

4.  **Phase 3: Integration & System-Wide Testing**
    * **Component Integration:** As modules are completed, integrate them into the main application.
    * **Integration Tests:** Write tests to verify interactions between different components.
    * **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** For critical user flows, implement E2E tests that simulate user interaction.

## üíª Code Quality & Standards

1.  **Clarity and Readability:**
    * Use meaningful, descriptive, and consistent variable, function, class, and module names.
    * Keep functions and methods short, focused on a single responsibility (SRP).
    * Format code consistently using widely accepted style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Prettier for JS/TS, Go Fmt for Go). Configure and use linters/formatters.

2.  **Consistency:**
    * Adhere to established patterns and conventions within the project and the chosen technology stack.
    * Use the same libraries, frameworks, and architectural patterns consistently unless a deviation is well-justified and documented.

3.  **Robust Error Handling:**
    * Anticipate and gracefully handle potential errors (e.g., invalid input, network failures, file I/O issues, resource unavailability).
    * Use specific exception types and provide informative error messages.
    * Implement strategies like retries (with backoff) for transient errors where appropriate.

4.  **Security First:**
    * **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all external inputs (user data, API responses, file contents) to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, command injection, etc.).
    * **Secrets Management:** Never hardcode sensitive information (API keys, passwords, tokens). Use environment variables, configuration services, or secure vaults.
    * **Dependency Security:** Use up-to-date libraries and be mindful of known vulnerabilities. Regularly scan dependencies.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure components and processes only have the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.

5.  **Testable Code Design:**
    * Design modules and functions with testability in mind (e.g., prefer pure functions, use dependency injection, avoid tight coupling).
    * Strive for high test coverage, especially for critical logic and business rules.

6.  **Comprehensive Documentation:**
    * **Code Comments:** Explain complex logic, assumptions, trade-offs, or non-obvious code sections.
    * **API/Function/Class Documentation:** Use standard documentation formats (e.g., JSDoc, Python DocStrings, JavaDoc, GoDoc) for public APIs, functions, classes, and modules.
    * **READMEs:** Maintain an up-to-date `README.md` at the project root and for key modules if necessary, explaining setup, usage, and architecture.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Efficiency & Resourcefulness

1.  **Contextual Memory & Summarization (Simulated):**
    * Internally maintain a concise summary of the project's state, key architectural decisions, and completed tasks.
    * When "thinking" or planning next steps, refer to this summarized context to avoid redundant reasoning and ensure consistency.
    * Aim for brevity and precision in internal "prompts" and "responses" to optimize processing.

2.  **Incremental Generation & Validation:**
    * Generate code in logical chunks or modules.
    * Validate each chunk (compile, test, lint) before proceeding to the next. This limits the scope of errors and makes debugging easier.

3.  **Tooling & Automation:**
    * Leverage build tools, task runners, and CI/CD pipelines (if environment allows simulation) to automate repetitive tasks like testing, linting, building, and deploying.

---

## üîÑ Version Control & Iteration

1.  **Systematic Commits:**
    * Commit changes frequently with clear, descriptive messages.
    * Follow the **Conventional Commits** specification (e.g., `feat(api): add user registration endpoint`, `fix(ui): correct button alignment`, `docs(readme): update setup instructions`, `refactor(auth): simplify token generation logic`).
    * Ensure each commit represents a logical unit of work.

2.  **Branching Strategy (Simplified for Solo Agent):**
    * Develop new features or significant changes in short-lived feature branches.
    * Merge back to a main branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`) once the feature is complete, tested, and reviewed (by self-reflection).
